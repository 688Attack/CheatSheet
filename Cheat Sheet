#Cloning
#Example of cloning a git folder
#Make sure you are in the folder where you want the clone to be
#ls - list folder contents
#ls -la - list folder content with hidden folders
#cd .. - go back directory
cd - set new directory 
Then you ready to clone
#git clone https://github.com/688Attack/Hyper-V.git


#Follow these commands to sync a new Repo
Create a Folder locally and also create a new folder in Github, you might as well use the same name for both.
From the terminal make sure your in the folder and follow these commands one by one.

git push -u origin master
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/688Attack/CheatSheet.git    <------Obviously copy the url from github
git push -u origin master

These insturction were coped from github, you see them when ever you create a new repo.

Once all this is in place you can just use the standard controls from within VSCode to Push, Pull, Sync and Merge.


This took me two days to work out so bloody use it!!!
